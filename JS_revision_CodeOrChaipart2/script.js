//a literal is a fixed, constant value written directly in the source code, representing data like numbers, text, or true/false states
window.document// is an object; there would be many things after document.loc,url...links
console.log(document.links);//node collection,html collection would give the html collection not array , we would be able to convert them in arr ; so they also have property link map etc
  

console.log("HEllo hitesh code or chai");
