TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

*TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.

TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.(need to install compiler but VScode have already installed)
